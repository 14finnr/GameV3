You creep down the silent hallway for a time, the walls becoming more constricted all the while, before eventually coming upon a set of worn stone steps leading down into a slightly wider room. Stepping down, you find yourself face to face with a bizarre stone statue residing in an otherwise empty room. The statue resembles a horned animal, with two empty sockets where its eyes should be and a third in its forehead.
