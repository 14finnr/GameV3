You find yourself standing face to face with a surly man in a plain brown uniform. He looks you up and down and says, "You know I'm supposed to leave ya out there, but truth be told, I could use the company. It gets awful boring down here". Unable to think of a response to that, you reply, "... there's a monster out there...". At this, the man furrows his brows, but then understanding floods his face. "Ah, you mean old Fred! He won't bother ya none as long as you do the same. Oh, but if you find anything shiny down here, leave it behind". He then turns away from you to sit down at a small table in an even smaller room. "Come play dice with me!", he then urges. "I never have no one to play with".
