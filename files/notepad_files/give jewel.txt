Reluctantly, you reach into your pocket and pull out the colorful stone you happened upon in your cell. You hand it over and it snatches the stone immediately. "Me jewel, me jewel!!", it yells, dancing around. It then runs up, hugs you so hard you think you might burst, then releases you and extends a hand with some sort of vial in it. "Take, take', it urges. "It make feel good". You take the vial, then the creature runs off to the west.
