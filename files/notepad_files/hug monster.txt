As it happens, this particular beast bears an uncanny resemblance to your hideous childhood pug, and you can't help but find it absolutely adorable. Before you know what you're doing, you've thrown yourself at it in a full-on embrace. You're not sure what the noise it made means, but it sounds a bit like 'surprised'. The beast steps away, looks at you for a long moment, and then slowly trudges off into the hall you came from.
