Within the lockbox you find a beautiful yellow gem, a strange murky potion, and another note. It reads, "If you're reading this then you've escaped. That is good. You must find the rest of the jewels. They are the key, my friend. Never be tempted to go toward the light." Since you already have the box, you don't need to take its contents.
