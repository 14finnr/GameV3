You find yourself in a dimly-lit room, with a surly man standing before you. 'Well I've never fished someone out of there before', the man says, 'and I'm prob'ly not supposed to, neither'. Then he shrugs. 'But I get awful bored down here, so company is welcome'. He then walks over to the small table in the center of the room and begins absentmindedly playing with a set of dice.
