You are in a small room lit by a fireplace in the corner. There is a man sitting at the table absentmindedly playing with a set of dice. There is a tiny little bridge to the west going over a small stream of water that passes from one hole in a wall to another. The bridge leads to an even dimmer hallway. There is also a door to the south.
