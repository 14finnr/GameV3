As you progress down the hall, it becomes darker than you ever bargained for. You have to feel the walls just to walk forward, and then... you stop. You've come to a wider section of the hall, and there's something strange about it. You can just barely make out a set of stone stairs leading downward to the south, and hear water from the north. But that's not it. There is a sound here, like a whispering from no direction and all of them.
