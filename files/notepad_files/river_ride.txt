Hesitantly, you dip yourself into the freezing water. When you drop fully into it you realize that the current is much stronger than you had imagined, and you are instantly pulled north by the stream. As you are carried away into the darkness you see, to your horror, that the stream heads directly into a small, man-made tunnel underground. You have no choice but to hold your breath and allow yourself to be pulled into it. Everything becomes dark, and you can feel yourself running out of oxygen as you are violently tossed around in the blackness of the submerged tunnel. Just when you're certain you will drown, you feel strong hands pull you from the depths and your vision is flooded with light.
