You step out into a great green field ending in a cliff overlooking the ocean. The sun is shining and the air is warm. Somewhere in the distance you hear a seagull. At first you are overjoyed to finally be free, but then you realize that there is no sign of civilization anywhere near you. You can see no roads, no smoke, no structures. Deciding that you must go somewhere if you are to survive, you pick a random direction and go. As the hours pass and dusk sets in, it begins to rain, slowly at first, but eventually becoming torrential. Desperately hoping to find some kind of shelter, you keep walking well into the night despite barely being able to see. When the rain finally lets up, you lay down in the mud and pass out shivering. When you wake up the shivering has become violent, and you are intensely cold. You look around and come to a horrible realization. You are in a great green field ending in a cliff overlooking the ocean. Carved into the side of a rocky outcropping is a dark tunnel. You have somehow walked in a circle. Choosing a different direction this time, you walk for as long as you can before collapsing. You curl up to try and keep yourself as warm as possible, and eventually surrender to sleep.

Your adventure is over.
