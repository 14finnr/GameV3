You walk for a very long time, with the light getting brighter all the while. After what must have been miles, you step into the blinding sunlight of the outside world. When your eyes adjust you can see that you have emerged from a tiny, hidden nook between two boulders, and that you are in a vast valley surrounded by rocky mountains and sharply sloped forests. Squinting, you spot a small cabin in the distance, and are overjoyed to see smoke coming from its chimney. You eagerly set off toward this beacon of civilization, but lose sight of it as you make your way through a particularly wooded area. You keep walking in the direction you think is correct for hours, and before you know it the sun is setting. You curl up and sleep fitfully on the hard ground. The next morning, you find a high spot on a large rock and spy the cabin again, but are dismayed at how far it still is. You must have walked in the wrong direction for some time yesterday. You again make it your day's work to hike to the cabin, but again lose sight of it and are forced to sleep when night falls. That morning you wake up exhausted and famished. You use every ounce of your strength to climb a tree, and now see the cabin farther away than it ever was, and in the wrong direction. You are devastated. You rally and walk in that direction, but can only go for a couple of hours before you collapse. In a resigned delirium, you wonder if anyone will ever find you. You fall asleep to the sound of wolves howling in the distance.

Your adventure is over.
