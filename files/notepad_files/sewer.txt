You are now in a dingy, but well-lit sewer area. You are surprised by a group of hooded figures about fifty yards away, chanting something incoherent. You dare not approach them. You also see a shrine to a god that you do not recognize, the body of a dead man in a corner, and a tunnel to the south that seems to have some light coming from it.
