You step into the bright room. Once your eyes adjust to the bright light, you find that you are in a small room that is filled with more wealth than you ever imagined. There are piles of gold coins as tall as you are, treasure chests overflowing with jewelry and gilded trinkets, all of it made of gold or silver and most decorated with finely cut gems. The room is lit by strange bright orbs embedded in the walls, and has a winding staircase leading upwards. You find a sack in a corner of the room and, naturally, fill it to the brim with treasure and embark up the staircase. The stairs end at a trap door in the ceiling, which you push open. Stepping out, you find yourself in a dilapidated shack that clearly hasn't been used in years. The shack has a large hole in the ceiling, no door, and not even a single piece of furniture to speak of. You walk outside and realize that you are on top of a rocky mountain, with a great wooded valley stretching out for miles beneath you. Far away in the valley, you spy a remote village amidst a clearing. You give a long sigh of relief, shoulder your sack of treasure, and prepare for the long hike to civilization.
